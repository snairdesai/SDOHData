1. ACS Data can be found [here](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/summary_file/) back to 2005, and PUMS data can be found [here](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data/pums/) back to 1996. For earlier archival data, visit the [IPUMS website](https://ipums.org/projects/ipums-usa) or [data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/).
1. ADI Data is too large to store on GitHub, so I've included a sample state (California) to give a preview of the data. You'll note the only available indicators are geographic IDs, and the ADI rankings themselves.
